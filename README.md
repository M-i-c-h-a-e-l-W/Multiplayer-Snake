# Multiplayer-Snake

This is my Mulitplayer-Snake game.
Its possible to play a normal Snake Game with Websockets in your lokal network with other friends.
If you want to  start the program on your computer you have to add the package in IntelliJ or an other IDEA and start the project with Spring Boot (the path of the main class is "org.snake.MainApplication").
If you have any questions please contact me.
