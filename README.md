# Website-Multiplayer-Snake

Hey, <br>
this is my Mulitplayer-Snake game.
Its possible to play a normal Snake Game with Websockets in your lokal network with other friends.
If you want to  start the program on your computer you have to add the package in IntelliJ or an other IDEA and start the project with Spring Boot (the path of the main class is "org.snake.MainApplication").
If you have any questions please contact me.


**Aim:**<br>
- [x] playing a snake which can eat fodder
- [x] snake should get some more points by eating or hitting other players
- [ ] player can play against each other on a server with a login (server and login issues)
- [ ] difference between user and admin
- [x] it should be possible to comment the site and communicate with a chatbox 
- [x] player choose their name and colour
- [x] on a server / playing via internet 

<br> ignore this: <br>
**Possible TODO´s :** <br>
- Snake Bild als Überschrift
- Kollision optimieren (Feld Array)
- Session mit Anmeldefunktion und login
- parallelität beim Spielstand beachten mutex
