# Website-Multiplayer-Snake

Hey, <br>
this is my Mulitplayer-Snake game.
Its possible to play a normal Snake Game with Websockets in your lokal network with other friends.
If you want to  start the programm on you computer you have to add the package in IntelliJ or an other IDEA and start the DemoApplikation class.
If you have any questions please contact me.


**Aim:** <br>
- playing a snake which can eat fodder
- snake should get some more points by eating or hitting other players
- player can play against each other on a server with a login
- difference between normaluser and admin
- it should be possible to comment the site and communicate with a chatbox 
- player choose their name and colour 

<br> ignore this: <br>
**Possible TODO´s :** <br>
- Snake Bild als Überschrift
- Kollision optimieren (Feld Array)
- Session mit Anmeldefunktion und login
- parallelität beim Spielstand beachten mutex
